Write an analysis (direct analytical memo report [253-55, A-14] 
with informative headings [98]) 
of a real direct mailing of your choice. 

Attach the direct mailing to the memo you write to your boss letting her know whether 
the designer of the mailing has adequately followed the criteria for marketing and sales messages 
or if the designer needs more training at the workshop scheduled to be in town in two weeks. 

The report should be direct with a main point at the end of the introduction. 
Remind your boss of the problem and your method (e.g. “You asked me to analyze Norwegian Cruise Line’s attached direct mailing.”). 
You can state the criteria or imply them by the support criteria you present. 
Use the AIDA method for your minimum criteria. 
Comment on the mailing’s positive and negative aspects. 
Refer to pages 217-22 for suggestions.
